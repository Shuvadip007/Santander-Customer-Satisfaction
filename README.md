# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction


## Overview
From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around—and they rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.  

Santander Bank is asking data analysts to help identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it’s too late.  

In this project, we analyze **hundreds of anonymized features** to predict whether a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.  

## Dataset
- The dataset comes from the **Santander Customer Satisfaction** Kaggle competition.  
- It contains anonymized numerical features representing customer interactions.  
- The target variable (`TARGET`) indicates whether a customer is **satisfied (0)** or **dissatisfied (1)**.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data analysis & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** – Machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**  

## Project Workflow
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Feature engineering & selection  
- Data normalization & transformation  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying patterns & trends in the data  
- Visualizing feature distributions and correlations  

### 3️⃣ Model Development
- Training multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluating performance using accuracy, F1-score, precision-recall  

### 4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- Understanding key features affecting customer satisfaction  
- Business strategies for improving customer retention
